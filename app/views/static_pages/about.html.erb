<h1>About me</h1>
<h2>Who am I</h2>
<p>My name is Jitse-Jan. I am a Software Engineer currently working for ASML Veldhoven in the Factory Automation and Integration department. In August 2013 I finished my Electrical Engineering degree at the Technical University of Eindhoven. My graduation project focused on a automatic way to detect food intake by using data from different sensors processed by classification algorithms. During my internship in Stellenbosch I worked on a pattern recognition tool to compare processing times of an FPGA and a normal desktop computer.Before doing these two big projects I have worked on numerous smaller projects. When I just started developing my software skills, I worked on a Flash website in a Super Mario 1 style, since I am a fan of the old-skool Nintendo consoles. After spending too much time and effort on creating all the necessary sprites, backgrounds and making all the frames time perfectly, I switched to a new website. Since then I have been using HTML, CSS and PHP for creating webpages. In my spare time I have created a number of websites for friends, to give them a tailored page as well as to keep myself up to date with the web standards. This way I have learned about the CSS3 standards, the HTML standards, SQL databases and writing more efficient PHP code.</p>
<p>During my web development I got more interested in other languages. I started with simple ‘languages’ like AutoIt and AutoHotKey and enjoyed the way code can automate things. Moreover, I enjoyed brainstorming about the underlying code and algorithms and how the software could be smarter and more efficient. By now I have used C, C++, Java and more recently I have been using Python both for work and spare time. To increase my Java knowledge I created a basic Android app for my outsourcing company for hour registrations for the employees. As a lesson for myself to become acquainted with Python, I have made an application that reads Google Spreadsheets and display them in an interface. The spreadsheets can be edited and saved online. Currently the application is still in alpha, but it was a good start to write my first Python code.</p>
<p>Besides web development and my software job, I enjoy to travel and photography and learn new tricks with the camera.
